# TLVibes

## Introduction

With TLVibes every tourist can enjoy multiple services that can help him in the city, all under one **super app**, and without messing around with numerous applications and registration processes. From looking for a nearby scooter through looking for an answer to a question regarding Tel Aviv to seeking the weather forecast for the upcoming days, all services will be under one platform, our super app - TLVibes.

## Purpose of System

The system purpose is to save expensive time for our users and bring them all the necessary and up-to-date services that they can find in Tel Aviv. All in one place without letting them mess with infinity services providers and different applications. TLVibes business model is based on two main paths, commercials for businesses in Tel Aviv and Brokerage commissions for service providers.
